 = CTemplate =

 [http://code.google.com/p/google-ctemplate CTemplate] is a "simple as possible for performance" template language. 

 Any objective my be met through the application of a combination of the following features.  And, when met this way, the result will have a maximal runtime performance.

 == Variable ==

 A value pulled from the scope context dictionary and emitted.
{{{
 {{var_name}}
}}}

 Accepted variable name strings start with an ASCII character and may include characters, numbers and underscore.  Variable names are case sensitive.

 == Section ==

 A section is iterated zero or more times.  Zero is hidden, and one or more is shown.
{{{
 {{#sectionName}}
   ...
 {{/sectionName}}
}}}

 The iteration of a section (or include) is controlled by the sections programmatically added into the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary] as child data dictionaries in a section list. 

 Section names have the same character class as variable names, but are not case sensitive under the Sections API of the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary].

 == Include ==

 The include is an "external" section.  The [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary] must enable the include by defining a section.   The include may be iterated zero or more times, according to the configuration of the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary].
{{{
 {{>name}}
}}}
 The context directory path is prepended, and the (dot "xtm") filename extension is appended to this name -- or a redirected name (see below).

 Note that template file base names (without path or dot- suffix) need to follow the naming conventions for variables and sections.  A base name starts with a character and includes characters, digits and underscore.  

 The include name can be redirected in its template file with a variable defined in the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary].  The value of the variable will be employed as the template file name.  In this case, the include section name remains the name defined in the template.

 When applied to the Sections API of the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary], the include base name as a section name is not case sensitive.  However, as a file name in reading the included template file, the case sensitivity of the file system applies.
