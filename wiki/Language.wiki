 = CTemplate =

 [http://code.google.com/p/google-ctemplate CTemplate] is a "simple as possible for performance" template language. 

 Any objective my be met through the application of a combination of the following features.  And when met this way, the result will have a maximal runtime performance.

 == Variable ==

 A value pulled from the scope context dictionary and emitted.
{{{
 {{var_name}}
}}}
 or (equivalently)
{{{
 {{=var_name}}
}}}
 Variable names are case sensitive.

 == Section ==

 A section is iterated zero or more times.  Zero is hidden, and one or more is shown.
{{{
 {{#sectionName}}
   ...
 {{/sectionName}}
}}}
 The iteration of a section (or include) is controlled by the sections programmatically added into the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary] as child data dictionaries in a section list. 

 == Include ==

 The include is an "external" section.  The [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary] must enable the include by defining one or more sections for one or more iterations of the include.
{{{
 {{>name}}
}}}
 The include name can be redirected in its template file with a variable defined in the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary].  A positive value for a variable of the same name will be employed as the template file base name.  Under variable redirection, the include section name remains the name defined in the template.

 The template file is resolved from the template name (or variable value) by prepending the context directory path, and appending the dot "xtm" filename extension.

 The resolved template file may be a URL.

 == Special iteration sections ==

 Within a section or include are defined five special sections as aids to iteration.  These are named for the section or include name string, with a special suffix string appended.  
{{{
 {{#field}}{{#field_it_NotFirst}},{{/field_it_NotFirst}} {{=field_name}}{{/field}}
}}}
 These special section names are enumerated in the following patterns.

 <dl>

 <dt><tt>name_it_NotFirst</tt>
 <dd> Sections in scope having a name in this pattern are visible when not in the first iteration.

 <dt><tt>name_it_First</tt>
 <dd> Sections in scope having a name in this pattern are visible in the first iteration.

 <dt><tt>name_it_NotLast</tt>
 <dd> Sections in scope having a name in this pattern are visible when not in the last iteration.

 <dt><tt>name_it_Last</tt>
 <dd> Sections in scope having a name in this pattern are visible in the last iteration.

 <dt><tt>name_it_Exclusive</tt>
 <dd> Sections in scope having a name in this pattern are visible when not the first and not the last.
