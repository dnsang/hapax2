 == Variable ==

 A value pulled from the scope context dictionary and emitted.

{{{

 {{var_name}}

}}}

 With Hapax 2.1.4, the value of a variable is interpreted for Hapax/CT language.  This feature permits complex templates to be written with variables that dereference with the full features of Hapax/CT.

 == Include ==

 A named template in the caller's context.  A directory path is
 prepended and the filename extension is added.

{{{

 {{>name}}

}}}

 An include may be visible or hidden according to the state of the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary].  This is the Sections API.  The name of the include, shown above, is a "section name" from the perspective of the data dictionary.  See "Sections", next, for more info.

 == Section ==

{{{

 {{#sectionName}}
   ...
 {{/sectionName}}

}}}

 A section is iterated zero or more times.  Zero is hidden, and one or more is shown.

 The iteration of a section (or include) is controlled by the sections programmatically added into the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary] as child data dictionaries in a section list.
