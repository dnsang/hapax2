 = CTemplate =

 == Variable ==

 A value pulled from the scope context dictionary and emitted.

{{{

 {{var_name}}

}}}

 Accepted variable name strings start with an ASCII character and may include characters, numbers and underscore.  Variable names are case sensitive.

 With Hapax 2.1.4, the value of a variable is interpreted for Hapax/CT language.  This feature permits complex templates to be written with variables that dereference with the full features of Hapax/CT.

 == Include ==

 A named template in the caller's context.  A directory path is
 prepended and the filename extension is appended.  

 Note that template file base names (without path or dot- suffix) need to follow the naming conventions for variables and sections.  A base name starts with a character and includes characters, digits and underscore.  

{{{

 {{>name}}

}}}

 An include may be visible or hidden according to the state of the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary].  This is the Sections API.  The name of the include, shown above, is a "section name" from the perspective of the data dictionary.  See "Sections", next, for more info.

 When applied to the Sections API of the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary], the include base name as a section name is not case sensitive.  However, as a file name in reading the included template file, the case sensitivity of the file system applies.

 == Section ==

{{{

 {{#sectionName}}
   ...
 {{/sectionName}}

}}}

 A section is iterated zero or more times.  Zero is hidden, and one or more is shown.

 The iteration of a section (or include) is controlled by the sections programmatically added into the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary] as child data dictionaries in a section list. 

 Section names have the same character class as variable names, but are not case sensitive under the Sections API of the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary].
