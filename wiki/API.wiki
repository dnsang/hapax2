 = Files =

 Files are named with "xtm" filename extension, and are loaded from a directory defined for the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateCache.java template loader].

 = Variables =

 Variables defined in the [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary] may be included into output, or will redirect includes.

 = Sections =

 CTemplate sections are repeated once for each [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary] found
 in their name.

 = Scopes =

 A CTemplate section or include enters the scope of a defined [http://code.google.com/p/hapax2/source/browse/trunk/src/hapax/TemplateDictionary.java data dictionary].  This scope inherits and overrides its parent scope.  Variables defined in the child scope of a section are clearly differentiated from other siblings and cousins.
